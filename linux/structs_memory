int - 4 bytes
char - 1 byte
float - 4 bytes

if the Stuct looks like this

struct test {
	int a;
	int b;
	char c;
	char d;
	float e;
}

int   a = 4 bytes
int   b = 4 bytes
char  c = 1 bytes + 1 pad
char  d = 1 bytes + 1 pad
float e = 4 bytes

the higest byte will be used and other variable will be padded accordingly (also depends on compilers)

so the total space requires for struct test is 16 bytes, we though the actual data only takes 14 bytes + 2 bytes are used for padding chars
