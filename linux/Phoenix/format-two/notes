you ltrace to find the exact paramter that we can write to in stack and map as parameter

because the address has \x00 its not exploitable in x64

gcc -m32 -o program program.c


./program $(printf "\x34\x90\x55\x56")%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%X%n

we have took the %X that was pointing to the stack where we can write and wrote the address of change me variable and tried %n, thus it will write the number of byte that was read to that stack address

thus we have changed the variable
