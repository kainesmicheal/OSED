The process of analysing a subject and to create representations of the system in another form or at a higher level of abstraction.  

The tool is not inherently good or bad, the issue is the use to which the tool is put.  

The idea is simple: we should develop a solid understanding of low-level software, and learn techniques that will allow us to easily dig into any program's binary and retireve information.  

	→ Reverse Engineering is a process where an engineered artifact is deconstructed in a way that reveals its inner most details, such as its design and architecture.  

	→ This is similar to scientific research that studies natural phenomean, with the difference that no one commonly refers to scientific reserach as reverse engineering, simply because no one knows for sure whether or not nature was ever engineered.
