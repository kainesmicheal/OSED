vuln method has 32 bytes buffer
	
checksec shows that NX bit is set

read 768 into a 32bytes buffer

[  0] = { 3,	TD,		SEN(read), "read"},
[  1] = { 3,	TD,		SEN(write), "write"},

read 

	eax = 0x0
	QWORD PTR [rsp+0x8] = address of buff
	QWORD PTR [rsp+0x10] = 0x300

	eax has len  of the input read
	set eax = 0x1
	push that to the top of the stack
	push address of the buffer to stop of the stack
	

	i can overwrite ebp value
	leave does
		mov esp, ebp
		pop ebp
		ret
