it reads exactly 31 keyboard strokes
replaces the 31th with '\0'

    char needthis [44];
    finalinput = (char *)malloc(0x171);
    __stream = fopen("flag.txt","r");
    fgets(needthis,0x2c,__stream);
    read(0,finalinput,0x170);
    printf(finalinput);

it is passing the finalinput directly to the printf without any formatspecifier, so this is a simple format string info disclosure

buffer is stored in the stack, so if we specify enough %p in the input, printf will try to all value from the stack
